## Description
_This is a project I created at Epicodus that allows a user to get a live exchange rate on six different currencies.  The user can submit their currency amount and receive the exchange value and exchange rate.  Additionally the user has the ability to swap currencies.  Developing this application helped grow my understanding of API's and Asynchronous code. This project represents my ability to navigate HTML, CSS, Markdown, JavaScript/jQuery, API's, and Github._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

1) Clone this repository to your desktop.
2) Navigate to the now installed directory and open in your editor of choice.
3) Create a .env file in the root directory of your cloned project.  You will store your personal API key in the .env.  *This step is very important, the application will not work without your API key, as the .env file has been added to the .gitignore.
4) Navigate to [ExchangeRate-API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/) and create a free API key (no payment necessary).
5)Copy and paste your free API key into the .env file
6) Open the directory in your terminal and run `$npm install`.
7) Once your terminal indicates the install is complete, run `$ npm run build`.
8) When you're ready to view the a live server of the project run `$ npm run start`.
